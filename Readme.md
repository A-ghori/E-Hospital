    User System (Login / OTP / Profile with avatar + phone + history)
    •	Prescription Module (doctor se generated, PDF / print enabled)
	•	Guest Mode (ticket book without login, but limited features)

    I add prescription details in user.js because auto linked when a login user filled a prescrption details that time automatically the history + avatar auto filled 


    For Guest user i dont use db i just sent a api request from frotend and fetch all te guest data in the frontend... it's temporary ...



    Tomorrow (5/09/2025) we need to just create the prescriptionController.js
